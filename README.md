# Redlock - A ruby distributed lock using redis.

> Distributed locks are a very useful primitive in many environments where different processes require to operate  with shared resources in a mutually exclusive way.
>
> There are a number of libraries and blog posts describing how to implement a DLM (Distributed Lock Manager) with Redis, but every library uses a different approach, and many use a simple approach with lower guarantees compared to what can be achieved with slightly more complex designs.

This is an implementation of a proposed [distributed lock algorithm with Redis](http://redis.io/topics/distlock). It started as a fork from [antirez implementation.](https://github.com/antirez/redlock-rb)

## Compatibility

Redlock works with Redis versions 2.6 or later.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'redlock'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install redlock

## Documentation

[RubyDoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/redlock/frames)

## Usage example

### Acquiring a lock

```ruby
  # Locking
  lock_manager = Redlock::Client.new([ "redis://127.0.0.1:7777", "redis://127.0.0.1:7778", "redis://127.0.0.1:7779" ])
  first_try_lock_info = lock_manager.lock("resource_key", 2000)
  second_try_lock_info = lock_manager.lock("resource_key", 2000)

  p first_try_lock_info
  # => {validity: 1987, resource: "resource_key", value: "generated_uuid4"}

  p second_try_lock_info
  # => false

  # Unlocking
  lock_manager.unlock(first_try_lock_info)

  second_try_lock_info = lock_manager.lock("resource_key", 2000)

  p second_try_lock_info
  # => {validity: 1962, resource: "resource_key", value: "generated_uuid5"}
```

There's also a block version that automatically unlocks the lock:

```ruby
lock_manager.lock("resource_key", 2000) do |locked|
  if locked
    # critical code
  else
    # error handling
  end
end
```

There's also a bang version that only executes the block if the lock is successfully acquired, returning the block's value as a result, or raising an exception otherwise. Passing a block is mandatory.

```ruby
begin
  block_result = lock_manager.lock!("resource_key", 2000) do
    # critical code
  end
rescue Redlock::LockError
  # error handling
end
```

### Extending a lock

To extend the life of the lock:

```ruby
begin
  lock_info = lock_manager.lock("resource_key", 2000)
  while lock_info
    # Critical code

    # Time up and more work to do? Extend the lock.
    lock_info = lock_manager.lock("resource key", 3000, extend: lock_info)
  end
rescue Redlock::LockError
  # error handling
end
```

The above code will also acquire the lock if the previous lock has expired and the lock is currently free. Keep in mind that this means the lock could have been acquired by someone else in the meantime. To only extend the life of the lock if currently locked by yourself, use the `extend_life` parameter:

```ruby
lock_manager.lock("resource key", 3000, extend: lock_info, extend_life: true)
```

### Checking if a lock exists

If you intend to try and acquire a lock always use [`#lock`](#acquiring-a-lock)

```ruby
lock_manager = Redlock::Client.new([ "redis://127.0.0.1:7777", "redis://127.0.0.1:7778", "redis://127.0.0.1:7779" ])

lock_manager.locked?("resource_key")
# => false

lock_info = lock_manager.lock("resource_key", 2000)
# => {validty: 1987, resource: "resource_key", value: "generated_uuid4"}

lock_manager.locked?("resource_key")
# => true
```

Note: The indication given here does not mean a client is currently holding the lock. It might indicate that a client is holding it, or was holding it, or is currently trying to acquire it. It does not even tell you that it is currently possible to acquire the lock by the client asking `locked?`

### Validating lock ownership

```ruby
lock_manager = Redlock::Client.new([ "redis://127.0.0.1:7777", "redis://127.0.0.1:7778", "redis://127.0.0.1:7779" ])
lock_info = lock_manager.lock("resource_key", 2000)

lock_manager.owner?(lock_info)
# => true

sleep 3

lock_manager.owner?(lock_info)
# => false
```

## Redis client configuration

`Redlock::Client` expects URLs or Redis objects on initialization. Redis objects should be used for configuring the connection in more detail, i.e. setting username and password.

```ruby
servers = [ 'redis://localhost:6379', Redis.new(:url => 'redis://someotherhost:6379') ]
redlock = Redlock::Client.new(servers)
```

Redlock works seamlessly with [redis sentinel](http://redis.io/topics/sentinel), which is supported in redis 3.2+.

## Redlock configuration

It's possible to customize the retry logic providing the following options:

```ruby
  lock_manager = Redlock::Client.new(
                  servers, {
                  retry_count:   3,
                  retry_delay:   200, # milliseconds
                  retry_jitter:  50,  # milliseconds
                  redis_timeout: 0.1  # seconds
                 })
```

For more information you can check [documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/redlock/Redlock%2FClient:initialize).

## Run tests

Make sure you have [docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

    $ make

## Disclaimer

This code implements an algorithm which is currently a proposal, it was not formally analyzed. Make sure to understand how it works before using it in your production environments. You can see discussion about this approach at [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2nt0nq/distributed_lock_using_redis_implemented_in_ruby/) and also the [Antirez answers](http://antirez.com/news/101) for some critics.
